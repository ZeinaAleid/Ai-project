# Ai Project
This repository contains a university assignment for the course **Artificial Intelligence**
at **Al-Balqaa Applied University**.
## Assignment 1
The purpose of this assignment is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
using **Google Colab** to better understand the selected dataset before
any machine learning or modeling steps.
### Dataset Description
The selected dataset is the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**, which contains
13 columns representing various sleep, health, and lifestyle factors.
The dataset provides insights into how daily habits and health conditions
may influence sleep quality.
## Objectives
The main objectives of this assignment are:
- Explore the structure of the dataset
- Analyze data distributions and relationships
- Identify patterns, trends, and correlations
- Extract meaningful insights before any modeling stage
  
This assignment focuses on **data understanding and analysis** rather than
building machine learning models.
