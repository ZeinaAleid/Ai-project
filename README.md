# Ai Project
This repository contains a university assignment for the course **Artificial Intelligence**
at **Al-Balqaa Applied University**.

## Assignment 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The purpose of this assignment is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
using **Google Colab** to better understand the selected dataset before
any machine learning or modeling steps.
### Dataset Description
The selected dataset is the **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**, which contains
13 columns representing various sleep, health, and lifestyle factors.
The dataset provides insights into how daily habits and health conditions
may influence sleep quality.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this assignment are:
- Explore the structure of the dataset
- Analyze data distributions and relationships
- Identify patterns, trends, and correlations
- Extract meaningful insights before any modeling stage
  
This assignment focuses on **data understanding and analysis** rather than
building machine learning models.

## Assignment 2 – Data Preprocessing

The purpose of this assignment is to perform a **basic data preprocessing step**
on the selected dataset. The focus of this task is to identify **missing (null) values**
in both numerical and categorical columns and apply appropriate methods to handle them.

### Missing Values Analysis
The dataset was examined to detect the presence of null values across all columns.
Both numerical and categorical features were checked to determine whether missing
data existed and to understand its distribution.

### Handling Missing Values
Simple and commonly used techniques were applied to handle missing values:

- For **numerical columns**, missing values were filled using statistical measures
  such as the mean or median.
- For **categorical columns**, missing values were filled using the most frequent
  value (mode).

These methods were chosen because the assignment emphasizes **basic preprocessing**
rather than advanced data cleaning or feature engineering techniques.

### Outcome
After handling missing values, the dataset became complete and suitable for
basic analysis. It is important to note that this preprocessing step was
**intentionally limited** and performed only to meet the requirements of
the assignment. A full and comprehensive preprocessing process was **not**
the objective of this task and may be applied in future assignments if needed.

### Dataset Description
For this assignment, the same dataset used in **Assignment 1** was reused in
order to maintain consistency. The **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** was
slightly modified by intentionally introducing additional null values in
both numerical and categorical columns.

This modification was done solely for **practice and demonstration purposes**,
allowing the application of missing value detection and handling techniques
as required by the assignment.
